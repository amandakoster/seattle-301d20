=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- There is no defined lecture topic for this day; instead, this is a workshop-style lecture that is directed towards using jQuery to collect form data and create a unique JSON string that can be used in their locally sourced blog article data.  Students should follow along during this workshop, essentially writing the same code as the instructor, and submit their code as a PR for review.

## Daily Plan

*(Note: This section will be filled in with more detail as we get closer to the day for this class)*
1. Code Review
2. Lecture/demo on new content
3. Review of the lab code

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Recap the primary concepts discussed throughout the week.

    * Ask the students "What have you learned so far?"

    * Ask "What has been challenging?"

    * Ask "What has been helpful?"

* Work through a form-based exercise to build out a JSON string.

* Discuss 3rd party library integration for dynamic code highlighting and markdown creation.
