=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- This day will be the first time most students use a templating engine like Handlebars.js - it will be beneficial to convey the importance of using templating to abstract away the tiresome work of DOM rendering.

## Daily Plan

*(Note: This section will be filled in with more detail as we get closer to the day for this class)*
1. Code Review
2. Lecture/demo on new content
3. Review of the lab code

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Identify different approaches to reusable HTML templates

* Effectively use templates to present user-entered (or server-provided) data (methods on the Handlebars object).

* Distinguish between the different Handlebars expression types ( **{{}}** vs **{{{}}}** ).

* Modify and style typographic components (**serif, san-serif fonts, font-size, font-family, color, font-weight**, etc)
