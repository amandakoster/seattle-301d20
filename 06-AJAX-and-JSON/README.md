=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- Starting with an introduction to the WRRC (web request response cycle), we will learn how HTTP works and how to accomplish simple GET requests through the use of AJAX and jQuery.

- One more thing: ES2015 syntax for variable declarations! `let` and `const` join the party.

## Daily Plan

*(Note: This section will be filled in with more detail as we get closer to the day for this class)*
1. Code Review
2. Lecture/demo on new content
3. Review of the lab code

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Identify when apps need persistence, to improve the UX and isolate the model logic in the code base.

* Explain how the browser uses the request-response (WRRC) cycle to render an HTML file or AJAX call.

* Analyze the localStorage object
