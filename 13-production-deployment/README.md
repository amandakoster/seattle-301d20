## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->
- The focus of this class is on students understanding the concept of production deployments in conjunction with development and production environments. Through the use of Heroku, you will guide students through the deployment process, configuration of environment variables, and general issues that can arise during the deployment phase of a project. Students should also understand development, production, and feature branches and how they are used in collaborative development.
