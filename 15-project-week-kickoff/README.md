## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Today we'll review the topics we've covered in the past 3 weeks and then establish the guidelines for moving into project week!*

Song for the day: ["The Final Countdown" by Gabe The Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn5vJ0dhxXs)

- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) should be published late this afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday. It is a graded portion of this course, regardless of student intent to advance to a 401 course.

- Students should be reminded that the exam is open-book, open-Google, open-Stack_Overflow, whatever resources they want to use. The exam is designed to be, in spots, a little bit beyond what has been covered. The intent in those spots is to measure resourcefulness and ability to adapt and figure something out. Remind students to give themselves adequate time for the exam: 1-2 hours depending if they are fast or slow on these kinds of things.

- Per usual, there will be a blackout on completing coursework during Project Week. Students should have all lingering unfinished coursework submitted by no later than Monday morning at 8:59am.

- Note that any unsubmitted assignments will be marked as a (temporary) zero by Monday. This is not punitive nor permanent: it is meant to be informative to show students where their course grade would stand if they never submit those assignments.

- To get any late work (or resubmits for higher grades) turned in after project week, make a plan for that with the instructor and/or the Admissions team so they know what students are working on, and when. Importantly, be aware of how this work progress and grades overlap with admissions requirements and deadlines for upcoming 401 courses. This is especially crititcal when enrollments are running high and there are possible waitlists for upcoming 401s.

<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->
There are no new learning objectives for this day, since it is primarily a review/transition day.
