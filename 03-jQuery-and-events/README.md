=======

## Overview

- This class focuses on introducing the underlying concepts of jQuery-based events, event binding, event delegation, and effects.

---

## Daily Plan

*(Note: This section will be filled in with more detail as we get closer to the day for this class)*
1. Code Review
2. Lecture/demo on new content
3. Review of the lab code

---

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Execute event bindings with jQueryâ€™s `$.on()` method

- Deter students from using the event method and to bind the event using `$.on()`

* Comprehend when event delegation is appropriate.

* Be able to configure event bindings using delegation.

* Familiarity with `data-`attributes & concatenation.

* Build dynamic jQuery selector strings.

* Use of `$(document).ready()`

## Lecture: jQuery & Events
<!-- List any high level topics, as well as any sub-topic, and associated details or notes that instructors may require to deliver this content -->

* jQuery Events

  * Review

      * Vanilla JS events recap (pg. 244)

      * Outline of Demonstrations:

          52. Connect the concept of events with the DOM

          53. Understand common browser events

          54. With jQuery, event listeners should be registered with `$.on()`

          55. Many DOM objects can have events attached

          56. Events are handled by callback functions

          57. Understanding ancestry of the DOM, how to traverse to child nodes (grandchild nodes?)

          58. Tabs are a common page idiom that can be implemented with a little jQuery

          59. Event handling can be used to override default behavior (like link click, or form submit)

          60. Chrome Dev Tools can help debug CSS/JS

      * Site design includes complimentary color choices

  * jQuery events

      * `$.on()`

          61. Whiteboard examples

          62. Read through the `$.on()` method documentation.

          63. Demonstrate use of `$.on()` with and without delegation.

      * click, change/input, scroll

      * Event delegation

          64. Discuss dynamically created and inserted elements, event bubbling, and event propagation.

  * Demonstrate event based concepts and code examples

      * These can be found on page 246 of the Duckett textbook.

  * Heavily demonstrate the use of the jQuery `$.data()` method

      * This should include getting data and setting data, and the differing formates of jQuery getters/setters

  * Demo - How

      * Demo hand-rolled page tabs

          65. Include the new script file.

          66. Demonstrate how to invoke a function inside of a `$(document).ready()`

          67. fill in the event handler code
