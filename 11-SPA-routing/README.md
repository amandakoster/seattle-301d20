=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- Using page.js, we will add route-based functionality to create a more performant and modular single page web application.  These routes should be simple, with a single callback that hands off control to the controller, which will call the appropriate method(s) to render the page to the DOM.

## Daily Plan

*(Note: This section will be filled in with more detail as we get closer to the day for this class)*
1. Code Review
2. Lecture/demo on new content
3. Review of the lab code

---

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Identify useful urls for an app, and be able to implement those routes given the new library presented.

* Recognize other server technologies such as node, new dependencies
