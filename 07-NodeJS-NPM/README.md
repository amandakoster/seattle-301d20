=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- Things are starting to change in a big way as we start looking at how server-side code works. The core lab task today is to build out a server.js file using Express that will replace the functionality students have been getting from live-server up to this point.
